He [loves music](http://spotify.com/user/curfewstudio "Follow Drew on Spotify") and [bad movies](https://letterboxd.com/drewacreative/ "Follow Drew on Letterboxd"). He lives with his plants and [takes photos](http://instagram.com/user/drewacreative "Follow Drew on Instagram") in Harlem (New York City).
