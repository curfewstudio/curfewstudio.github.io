Working with the founder of _Spooked Kooks_, a soft-top surfboard company in New Zealand, I created a logo system that embodies the vibrant spirit of their brand. The _Spooked Kooks_ brand is inspired by 90's horror and the punk movement. The new logo needed to infuse these themes into surf culture without taking itself too seriously. We boiled it down to a severed shaka (or "hang loose") hand and some chunky custom type.
