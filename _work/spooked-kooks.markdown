I worked with the founder of Spooked Kooks, a New Zealand surfboard company, to create a logo that embodies the spirit of their brand. Spooked Kooks is inspired by 90's horror and the punk movement, and their logo needed to reflect that. We boiled it down to a severed shaka (or "hang loose") hand and some chunky custom type.
