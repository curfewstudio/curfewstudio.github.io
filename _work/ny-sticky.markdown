summary: New York-themed iMessage sticker pack published by Sticker.Place
---

I created a series of 31 New York-themed iMessage stickers which were published by [Sticker.place](http://sticker.place). My goal was to make stickers that could be appreciated by die-hard locals as well as those who had never visited New York. I centered the pack around two main characters: a pigeon and a rat, and built it out from there. The pack can be purchased on the iMessage App Store [here](http://curfe.win/nysticky).
