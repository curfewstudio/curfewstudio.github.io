summary: An email framework for WCS
Key: 
---

My team at the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) needed a response to a growing demand for marketing emails without sacrificing design and quality. To meet this need I developed a tool which would allow non-technical users to create and edit emails with bulletproof code.

The brand and iconography were created to be warm and inviting so that users would feel more comfortable on the platform.

For the first time, my team can review, build, and edit emails on the go.

After training my team I integrated their feedback immediately into product development.

As of this writing, four themes with 200+ customizable modules are available in Stork and over 80 emails have been created using the tool.

This toolchain takes full advantage of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Prose](http://prose.io/). It will be made open-source for additional contributions in late 2017.
