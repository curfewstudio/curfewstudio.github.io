My team at the Wildlife Conservation Society needed a way to respond to a growing demand for more emails without sacrificing on design and quality. I developed a tool which would allow non-technical users to create and edit emails with bulletproof code. 

For the first time, my team has the ability to review, build, and edit emails on the go.

The iconography was created to be warm and inviting so that users would feel more comfortable on the platform.

As of this update, three themes, 198 customizable modules, and over 40 emails were created.
