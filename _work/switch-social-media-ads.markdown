summary: I created a series of social media ads for Switch
---

Switch, a job-search app, contracted me to illustrate and
design a series of social media ads with a focus on drawing in new users and spreading awareness about the company. Copy was
provided and I worked with the team to develop each concept and design the final ads.

#### An ad series using Instagramâ€™s (new at the time) carousel ads. This ad targeted project managers.
