I created a series of 31 New York-themed iMessage stickers which were published by [Sticker.place](http://sticker.place). I wanted to make stickers that could be appreciated by die-hard locals as well as those who had never visited the city. I centered the pack around two characters: a pigeon and a rat, and built it out from there. You can buy the pack here. Animation and more stickers are coming soon!
