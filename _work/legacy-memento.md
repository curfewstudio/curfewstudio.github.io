# Sample Case Study

Background: At the Wildlife Conservation Society, we needed a way to thank families of donors who had left the organization in their will. A legacy wall had been erected to honor these donors at the Bronx Zoo. I used a watercolor screen printing process to create unique prints for each donor of matching birds.
